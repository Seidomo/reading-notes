# Programming With Javascript

Before you learn how to read and write the JavaScript
language itself, you need to become familiar with some key
concepts in computer programming. They will be covered in
three sections:

- A What is a script and how do I create one?
- B How do computers fit in with the world around them? 
- C How do I write a script for a web page?
   
# WRITING A SCRIPT

- *To write a script, you need to first
   state your goal and then list the
   tasks that need to be completed in
   order to achieve it.*


Humans can achieve complex goals without thinking
about them too much, for example you might be
able to drive a car, cook breakfast, or send an email
without a set of detailed instructions. But the first
time we do these things they can seem daunting.
Therefore, when learning a new skill, we often break
it down into smaller tasks, and learn one of these at
a time. With experience these individual tasks grow
familiar and seem simpler.
Some of the scripts you will be reading or writing
when you have finished this book will be quite
complicated and might look intimidating at
first. However, a script is just a series of short
instructions, each of which is performed in order
to solve the problem in hand. This is why creating a
script is like writing a recipe or manual that allows a
computer to solve a puzzle one step at a time.
It is worth noting, however, that a computer doesn't
learn how to perform tasks like you or I might; it
needs to follow instructions every time it performs
the task. So a program must give the computer
enough detail to perform the task as if every time 
were its first time.
